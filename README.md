# 315 Final Project
This is my NEWM-N 315 final project. I recreated a product page inspired by Keurig, included a shopping cart feature, followed an MVC model, and integrated firebase authentication.
Each product on the products page is stored in a JSON object and loaded individually. To add an item to the cart, simply click the "BUY NOW" button, and a counter will appear on the cart icon in the top navigation.
For the login functions, click on the account button in the top navigation, and a modal will appear. Here, you can enter your login information or sign up. Once you are signed in, the modal will switch to allow you to sign out when needed.
